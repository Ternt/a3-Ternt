My application is a simple form that asks for your username, firstname, lastname, bday, and password. It then uses that to generate an email.
For the styling, I used alot of flex box to center, space, and layout items. I had class styles to apply more general styling to the page and ID 
styles for more specific elements. Additionally I have some extra dynamic JavaScript styling. The following components were styled through JavaScript:

- A password input component
- An editable table field component
- Text inputs

# Technical Achievements

- Single Page Application
- Modify data, data gets sent to the server
- Delete data, request to delete data gets sent, performed. Updated data is sent back and client is updated.

# Design Achievements

1. Daniel Zhang
2. Navigating between login and results was annoying, especially since the SPA implementation isn't robust.
3. They said my editable table component was awesome.
4. Rather than having them as two separate pages, I would have them together in one page so that the instant feedback is noticeable.
